In Feynman's lecture's an interesting story is presented with the purpose of illustrating the limitations of using algebra to describe concepts such as velocity. This particular paradox of Achilles and The Tortoise was developed by Zeno.

Consider that Achilles runs 10x as fast as a Tortoise, nevertheless he can never catch the Tortoise, for suppose they start where the tortoise is a 100m ahead. 

1. When Achilles has ran the 100m the tortoise will be 10m ahead.
2. When Achilles has ran the 10m the tortoise will be 1m ahead
3. When Achilles has run the 1m the tortoise will be 10cm ahead.

A finite amount of time can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, and so there are an infinite number of steps in the above argument if we were seeking to discern the point at which Achilles reaches the tortoise. This is one of the complexities that arises when thinking about [[Velocity]].s
